Hi, Iâ€™m @Alan-Lomax

I'm a Retired Electrical Engineer who over my career specialized in automation and distributed control systems (Hardware and Software).<br> 
I am interested in Model Railways, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, 3D printing and general technical stuff. <br>
I am currently learning the ESP32 ins and outs on a dedicated network in my lab. (well ... allright then .. spare bedroom!)
